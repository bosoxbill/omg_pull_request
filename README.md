## Omg!  Pull Request!

Omg! Pull Request! is a daemon designed to easily run automated tests for a project that is hosted on GitHub on the submission of a pull request.  On completion of the tests the daemon will make a comment on the pull request on the status of the test suite.

#### Goals

* Allow simple configuration for a standard rails project
* Support flexibilty and extensibility to work in non ruby/rails projects
* Reduce test failures caused by merging in code with broken tests

#### Non Goals

* Work with non-github environments


### Integrations

The project integrates with a number of third party services to maximize usefulness / coolness.

#### Prowl

Prowl integration allows you to setup a phone to be alerted when the test suite completes.  You will be alerted if you are the author, or have commited in the pull request.

#### Lolcommits

On running the test suite an animated gif can be generated of the lolcommits that were generated by the pull request.  This feature was added for the lulz.

## Installation

* In a rails project, add `omg_pull_request` to the Gemfile.
* Make an `omg_pull_request` directory in the project's `test` directory.
* Add a `database.yml` file in the `omg_pull_request` dir.  This will drop databases, so it is suggested this points to different databases than the main `config/database.yml` file
* Create a github user to run the tests as.  This user will need to have access to the repo the test is run on.  It can be your developer account, or a new account specifically for this.
* Add a `config.yml` file in the `omg_pull_request` dir.  It follows this template:

```
repo_owner: kenmazaika
repo: pictures
locale: en
runner: Rails 

github_credentials:
  login: github_user 
  password: github_password

storage:
  provider: Aws
  access_token: s3_token
  secret_token: s3_secret 
  bucket: s3_bucket

prowl:
  application: wherebot
  keys:
    kenmazaika: key
    kenmazaika@gmail.com: key
```

This is a sample config, with sensitive data scrubbed for running tests on the repo: https://github.com/kenmazaika/pictures.  One important note is for the prowl integration it should contain a key for both the github user_name and the email address that can be pulled from git.

* On a server someplace clone the repo.  This cloned repo will be managed by the daemon, and the tests will run on it from now on.
* In a screen session run `omg_pull_request`.
* Enjoy.

### Example

You can see an example of a successful pull request that has been `omg_pull_request`ified here: https://github.com/where/omg_pull_request/pull/1.  And an example of a failed pull request that has been `omg_pull_request`ified here: https://github.com/where/omg_pull_request/pull/2.
